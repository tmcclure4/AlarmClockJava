# AlarmClockJava
Alarm Clock Implemented in Java
This application is similar to the alarm clock gui of the iPhone. 

When the alarm goes off, a web page will open up. The web page that opens up should be a website that has
music, so the user will know the alarm is going off. Additionally a pop up window will show up, indicating the alarm has gone off.

The user can name the alarm, set the URL to be opened when the alarm goes off, set their day preferences, and set the time the alarm
will go off.

The user can additionally go to a different part of the application which shows the current alarms in the system and whether they are
active or not. The user can manually select or de-select certain alarms as active or inactive. The user can additionally delete
alarms from the database. There is a max of 15 alarms that can be stored.
